# OCEAN:ICE

## Ocean-Cryosphere Exchanges in Antarctica: Impacts on Climate and the Earth System

OCEAN:ICE is a Horizon Europe project, funded by the European Commission and UKRI, and running from November 2022 to October 2026.

OCEAN:ICE focuses on understanding how the Antarctic Ice Sheet and the Southern Ocean processes influence our global climate.
More specifically it focuses on understanding the interaction between the AIS and the sea level rise, deep water formation and ocean circulation and climate.

OCEAN:ICE considers the critical role of feedbacks between ocean circulation, ice sheet change and tipping points and the global climate.

This book provides researchers and stakeholders an interactive tool to understand how OCEAN:ICE is collecting, making available and processing ocean observations.

### Interactive tools

OCEAN:ICE is a sponsor of the Southern Ocean Observing System (SOOS).

The SOOS mission is to facilitate the sustained collection and delivery of essential observations of the Southern Ocean to all stakeholders. This is achieved through the design, advocacy, and implementation of cost-effective observing and data delivery systems.

The overall vision of SOOS is for "sustained observations of the dynamics and change in the physics, chemistry, biology, and geology of the Southern Ocean system to be readily accessible." This data will provide a foundation for enabling the international scientific community to advance understanding of the Southern Ocean and for managers to address critical societal challenges.

OCEAN:ICE contributes to SOOS by:
- Providing data collected during project campaigns.
- Sharing models or data elaboration to enrich the SOOS catalog.
