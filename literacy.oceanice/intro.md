# OCEAN:ICE

## Ocean-Cryosphere Exchanges in Antarctica: Impacts on Climate and the Earth System

OCEAN:ICE is a Horizon Europe project, funded by the European Commission and UKRI, and running from November 2022 to October 2026.

OCEAN:ICE focuses on understanding how the Antarctic Ice Sheet and the Southern Ocean processes influence our global climate.
More specifically it focuses on understanding the interaction between the AIS and the sea level rise, deep water formation and ocean circulation and climate.

OCEAN:ICE considers the critical role of feedbacks between ocean circulation, ice sheet change and tipping points and the global climate.

This book provides researchers and stakeholders an interactive tool to understand how OCEAN:ICE is collecting, making available and processing ocean observations.
