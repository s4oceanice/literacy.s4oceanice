BUILD AND DEPLOY:

The steps to manually build and upload the page to github as a static website are the following:

	1. Build the static html by running in the terminal the following command:

		jupyter-book build ./literacy.oceanice

	2. Move the content of the newly generated folder _build/html into root folder /docs
	3. Add to the same folder an empty file called: .nojekyll
	4. Open the file basic.css, found inside docs/_static and add the following at the end:
	
	html[data-theme="dark"] .bd-content img:not(.only-dark):not(.dark-light){
   	 background: transparent !important;
	    padding: 0px !important;
	}

	table{
	    color: #505050 !important;
	}

	5. Git add., git commit -m '<commit-message>', git push

Alternatively the scripts called build.sh, found in the root folder of the repository, does all the above automatically.
The only interaction needed from the user is the entering of the commit message.
With this automated method the css corrections have to be inserted into the file corrections.css in the root folder of the repository.
These will be appended to _static/basic.css by the script.
