to render the jupyter book as an interactive website these are some of the options:

	- nbinteract  (works only with earlier versions of Python (-> 3.5))
	- host the github repo on Binder (gave an error)
	- ipywidgets HTML embedding
	- voila + binder (?)
	- JS?
	- currently trying j1_nbinteract package which works with python 3.9
	- neurolibre / JOSS
